# Laugh Portal / Web3 Project with Buildspace

### About This Project

A first web3 project. Smart contract written in Solidity, frontend written in React. Javascript used with Hardhat to tie together the React frontend and the Solidity smart contract, test smart contract, etc. 

### What I Learned

We worked with the following "tools":
- Hardhat
- Alchemy
- Metamask
- React
- Replit

I was familiar with Replit, somewhat familiar with React and Metamask, but Hardhat and Alchemy were new to me. Fantastic tools!

I also gained a far better understanding of Solidity than with the Moralis courses I had taken. The Buildspace team did a great job!

### Buildspace

[Buildspace](https://buildspace.so) provided excellent instruction with a very deep dive into the entire entire process of developing, testing, and deploying a web3 app.  

I received a **Buildspace NFT** - [see it on Opensea](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3cd266509d127d0eac42f4474f57d0526804b44e/3647) - for completing this project.
